I understand the vital role played by businesses, particularly small neigh- borhood enterprises, in making Chicago the world class city it is. We are committed to creating  an environment that provides support to all types of business owners, allows innovators the room  they need to flourish, and encourages healthy and prosperous communities.  I am extremely proud of all that has been accomplished since 2011. In response to issues raised  by the small business community, we have created the one-stop-shop Small Business Center, cut our total number of  business licenses from 117 to 40, and moved many of our processes online. We have encouraged innovation through  the Emerging Business Permit and by reducing fees for over 10,000 business owners. Our community groups have  expanded their connection to neighborhood businesses by offering free resources and services to tens of thousands  of Chicagoans. As part of our commitment to invest in all areas of the city, we have granted over $11 million to fund  neighborhood businesses in the South and West Sides.   All Chicagoans should look with pride at our flourishing business community, but I am not satisfied. There is more  we can do to support business growth. Therefore, I am committing to a series of initiatives to help small business and  entrepreneurs thrive:             • A reduced “start-up” fee for new business licenses that cuts the cost in half • An expansion of the sidewalk café season to allow for full year operations • The publication of a license issuance clock to increase transparency and accountability • The creation of a pop-up permit  •  A reduction of the inspection burden through new checklists, cross-training, increased technology, and the   elimination of unnecessary regulations and inspections.   To all of our entrepreneurs, the City is your partner. Chicago has always been and will continue to be open for business.                                                          Sincerely,  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  Dear Chicagoans,  Chicago’s  business  community  is  thriving,  with  over  60,000  active  business  licenses.  As  the   Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP), it is my job to   support businesses across the city and I am dedicated to doing everything possible to help small  business owners achieve their dreams.   Through the support of Mayor Emanuel, my Department has spearheaded numerous initiatives to   support the business community of Chicago. However, we are not alone -- this report features   the efforts undertaken by all City Departments and community organizations, from the Department of Public Health’s  efforts to improve inspection success rates, to the Department of Buildings’ work to reduce the building code burden,  to the business grants offered by the Department of Planning and Development to ignite business growth in every   neighborhood, to the incredible work done by our partner agencies in the community. Chicago is all in for small  business.   Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and our communities thrive because of its businesses. In this report, we highlight  some of the small business owners that make our communities extraordinary. The entrepreneurial experience provides  context for everything we do at BACP, and we are excited for the new initiatives that will make it even easier to launch  and grow your business in Chicago.   Thanks to all of the City Departments and community organizations that made this report possible by working tirelessly  to support Chicago’s businesses. More importantly, thanks to Chicago’s small business owners.  Your innovation, hard  work, and entrepreneurial spirit are what make this city great. We have your back and are committed to continuing to  create a welcoming, supportive, and strong business environment.                                                         Sincerely,  Commissioner Rosa Escareno  Table of Contents  The priority areas listed below have provided direction to all our  past initiatives and will shape our future endeavors. This report  highlights the key initiatives from BACP, City Departments, and  community  partners  within  the  four  areas  that  have  ensured  a  thriving small business ecosystem in Chicago.

The report also charts Mayor Emanuel’s commit- ment  to  continue  our  progress  in  the  coming  months,  through  the implementation of specific initiatives and the achievement of  long-term goals.   PROMOTING INNOVATION  AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  Chicago  is  fortunate  to  have  many  entrepreneurs  looking  to  take  their  creative  and   innovative ideas and turn them into prosperous businesses. We are committed to ensuring  a regulatory environment that is welcoming to innovation and growth and open to new  business ideas. We encourage Chicago’s many burgeoning entrepreneurs to invest in their  ideas and we will work together to make your concept a reality.   EMERGING BUSINESS PERMIT We know that the private sector can innovate faster than any government. That is why we  created  the  Emerging  Business  Permit  to  license  new  businesses  that  do  not  fall under our existing regulatory framework. Instead of saying “no,” we find  a  way  to  make  it  work.  Innovators  such  as  Juana  Ryan,  a  mobile  boutique   operator, have used this tool to succeed in Chicago.  THE CITY   HAS MY BACK  The consultants were enthusiastic and supportive about my  business venture and made me feel that they truly cared about  the success of StellaLily. I am truly grateful that I chose to    open a new business in Chicago.   Juana Ryan, StellaLily  1  ““””PROMOTING INNOVATION  AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CITY Obtaining  City  contracts  is  an  important  step  for  many  small  businesses  looking  to  grow.  The  Department  of   Procurement Services (DPS) has created over twenty programs to increase the pool of bidders on City contracts,  incentivize  the  use  of  small,  minority,  and  women-owned  businesses,  build  capacity  of  local  businesses,  and   encourage  the  employment  of  local  residents.  DPS  also  offers  over  fifteen  different  classes  on  procurement  and   certification  programs,  free  to  the  public,  for  entrepreneurs  to  learn  about  a  wide  variety  of  topics,  including   Procurement Fundamentals, How to Become Certified, and How to Navigate the DPS Website.  NEXT STEPS                 1 2 3            PROMOTE GROWTH THROUGH A REDUCED START-UP LICENSE FEE   Opening a new business poses a significant financial challenge to business owners. Mayor Emanuel is   proposing a fee reduction for start-ups -- we will grant all new Limited Business License applicants a   2-year license for a 1-year fee. This will provide financial relief to a broad array of up and coming   business owners and allow them to pump more money into their new business.    ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH POP-UP PERMITTING   All entrepreneurs would benefit greatly from the opportunity to test the market and their concept and   get a feel for a location before acquiring a lease. We will be creating a “pop-up” permit that allows   for certain retail food activities in pre-approved pop-up locations and work with our chambers and   community partners to promote general retail and food pop-ups.   FURTHER DEVELOP OUR FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT   AND ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES   Based on the successful operation of the Emerging Business Permit, we are creating a new business   activity under the Regulated Business License to allow mobile boutique operators to operate under a   permanent licensing category. This proves the success of the Emerging Business Permit: the City will   work with you, even if your business doesn’t fit into a category under the current regulation. We will   continue to seek new license categories that will expand our regulatory structure to encourage   innovative businesses.    4  REDUCING RED TAPE  LICENSE REFORM In 2011, Chicago had more license types than Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Atlanta combined. Today,  we have eliminated and consolidated license types to reduce total licenses from 117 to 40, reducing confusion and  saving time and money for business owners.  PUBLIC WAY PERMIT STREAMLINING We heard the suggestions of our community partners and have streamlined the permitting process for all uses of the  public way, including signs, canopies, awnings, benches, and marquees. We know that a delay on a sign permit can  have a significant impact on opening time for a business, and we are committed to improving the process.   	  	  4 We have reduced issuance time by 30 days for 6,098 permits  4 We have expedited issuance time for signs by 60%  6  ","[{'docTokenBegin': 3, 'docTokenEnd': 4, 'tokenBegin': 3, 'tokenEnd': 4, 'text': 'Chicago', 'characterOffsetBegin': 18, 'characterOffsetEnd': 25, 'ner': 'CITY'}]"

Daley, Mayor  Foreclosures can affect anyone. If you are a renter whose building is in foreclosure, there are laws that protect you and that  govern what can and cannot happen during the foreclosure process. The City of Chicago wants to make sure that you know  the law and what rights, responsibilities and resources you have if the building where you live is in foreclosure.   Your RIGHTS  Renters have the following legal rights when their building experiences foreclosure: •   Within seven days of being served a foreclosure complaint, the owner or landlord of your building must notify    •   If a landlord has already been named in a foreclosure suit, he must disclose this to you before you sign a lease •   If  the  landlord  fails  to  notify  you  of  foreclosure,  you  may  be  eligible  to  terminate  your  lease  (see  Section  5-12-095    you in writing  of the Municipal Code and/or seek legal advice before utilizing this option)  •   Tenants who have been summoned to court must be given at least 90 days notice to vacate the property   •   If eviction is due to a building foreclosure, the tenant’s eviction record will be sealed if they are current in their rent or have   made good faith attempts to pay  •  If a foreclosure has been filed your lease is still valid •   Tenants must continue to pay rent to be eligible to receive these protections •   The law prohibits any threat or attempt to lock tenants or their possessions out of their units •   If a foreclosure has been filed, your lease is still valid.  Your RESPONSIBILITES  It is important to make sure you do all you can to protect yourself if your building is in foreclosure: •   Maintain good records, including copies of your lease, proof of security deposit and proof of rent payments/receipts •   Pay the rent on time with a money order or check and document attempts to make payments •   Be alert for warning signs that the building may be in foreclosure—utility shut-offs, landlord not collecting rent •   Keep identification and proof of tenancy handy in the event of an eviction order •   Open all mail even if it says “occupant” or “unknown occupant” •   Seek legal assistance or advice to understand your rights •   Be aware of unscrupulous people claiming to be the new landlord and seek legal help or contact law enforcement     authorities if you suspect a scam  Your RESOURCES Legal: •	 Lawyers Committee for Better Housing–Free legal representation    Call (312) 347-7600 www.lcbh.org •    Call the Central Office at (312) 341-1070 to be directed to nearest office www.lafchicago.org Financial: •    The Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago–Free legal representation for low-income renters   There are limited funds available for income-eligible households to assist with emergency relocation rental assistance  Call 311and request “short-term help”  If you are a CHA Housing Choice Voucher holder and in need of assistance due to building foreclosure,   •    Call (312) 935-2600 General:  Metropolitan Tenants Organization–provides information about your rights  •    Call the hotline at (773) 292-4988 www.tenants-rights.org  F.A.I.R. Información sobre embargo para inquilinos: Asistencia para inquilinos afectados por el embargo  Ciudad de Chicago Richard M. Daley, Alcalde  Los embargos pueden afectar a cualquiera y si usted es un inquilino cuyo edificio ha sido embargado, existen leyes que  regulan lo que puede o no puede ocurrir durante el proceso de embargo. La Ciudad de Chicago desea asegurarse que usted  conoce la ley, los derechos, responsabilidades y recursos que usted tiene si el edificio donde usted renta es embargado.  Sus DERECHOS  Los inquilinos tienen los siguientes derechos legales cuando su edificio es embargado: •   La  ordenanza de la Ciudad requiere que todos los propietarios de unidades de renta notifiquen a sus inquilinos dentro   de siete (7) días después de que se haya archivado la demanda para el juicio hipotecario en la propiedad de rentas  •   Si el propietario del edificio omite notificarle del embargo judicial, es posible que usted pueda terminar su contrato de  arrendamiento (ver la sección 5-12-095 del código municipal y obtenga conserjería legal antes de utilizar esta opción) •   Si el propietario del edificio a sido nombrado en un embargo judicial, el tiene que revelarlo antes de que firme el con-  trato de arrendamiento.  •   Los inquilinos que han recibido una citación de la corte tienen por lo menos 90 días después de recibir la notificación    para dejar vacante la propiedad  •   Si el desalojo se debe al embargo del edificio, el récord de desalojo del inquilino se mantendrá cerrado si el inquilino   esta al corriente con su renta o ha tratado de pagar la renta  •  Los inquilinos tienen que continuar pagando la renta para poder recibir estas protecciones  •  La ley prohíbe cualquier amenaza o intento de clausurar la unidad dejando al inquilino fuera de la unidad y sin sus         pertenencias •  Cuando un embargo judicial ha sido archivado con la corte su contrato de arrendamiento es todavía valido.  Sus RESPONSABILIDADES  Es importante hacer todo lo que pueda para protegerse si el edificio donde renta ha  sido embargado: •    Mantenga sus archivos en orden, incluyendo copias de su acuerdo de renta, prueba de su depósito y recibos de  pagos de la renta  las utilidades o que el propietario no recoja la renta  •  Pague la renta a tiempo con un giro postal o cheque y documente los intentos que ha hecho de pagar su renta •  Mantengase alerta de las señales que advierten que el edificio donde renta podría estar embargado-el cese de    •  Mantenga a la mano prueba de identificación y de que usted es el inquilino en  caso de que reciba una orden de   •  Abra toda la correspondencia aun si esta dice”occupant” (inquilino) or “unknown occupant”(inquilino desconocido) •  Busque asistencia legal o asesoria para entender sus derechos •  Este alerta de personas inescrupulosas que afirman ser los nuevos propietarios y busque ayuda legal o contacte las     autoridades si usted sospecha que lo están tratando de estafar  desalojo  Llame a la oficina central al (312) 341-1070 para ser dirigido a la oficina más cercana www.lafchicago.org  Sus RECURSOS Legales: •  Lawyers Committee for Better Housing–Representacion legal gratuita.

No electrical drawing that pertains to the control booths have been found – does one  exist?  See Drawing Sheets E-102, ES-205, and ES-602  There are discrepancies for the guard booths between specification 13128 and what is  shown on A-102. Please clarify what is to be followed.  The  Specification  Section  13128  has  precedence  over  Drawing  Sheet  A-102.  A  note has been added to the Drawing Sheet A-102.  The  Moment  Slab/Blast  Fence  Foundation  for  Retaining  Wall  #2  (Sheet  CS-411  Section A-A) has a depth of 4’.  The 5’ wide lower section is approximately 6’ from the  back of wall panel.  However, the minimum strap length for the MSE wall is 8’.  This  appears there will be a conflict.  Note 1 on the drawing states the dimensions are for  bidding  purpose  and  the  final  dimensions  will  be  determined  by  the  contractor.  Will  there  be  an  allowance,  to  cover  potential  additional  costs for  design  and  installation  that may be beyond what is shown in the drawing?  The  foundation  configuration  concept  portrayed  beneath  the  proprietary  blast  fence on Drawing Sheet CS-411 is subject to change by the Contractor based on  coordination with their selected blast fence and proprietary MSE wall suppliers.   Specification  Section  F-165  Jet  Blast  Protection  Fence  includes  provisions  related to the design of the foundation, coordination with the MSE wall design,  and pay items to compensate for these activities.  Part  1  1.03  B.1  states  system  must  consist  of  a  sacrificial  type  Cathodic  Protection  system.

Intent is that design and construction of the retaining walls are in conformance  with Illinois Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and  Bridge  Construction  Specification  Section  522.    This  has  been  clarified  by  adding Specification Section 03600, Part 1, 1.02 C.  Section  03600,  Part  2,  2.01  B  Second  Paragraph  –  External  Loads,  such  as  those  applied  through  structure  foundations,  from  traffic  or  railroads,  slope  surcharge,  etc.  shall  be  accounted  for  in  the  internal  stability  design.  What  are  the  expected  traffic  loads? Is it 250 psf traffic surcharge or the aircraft loading.  If it is aircraft loading, what  is the expected aircraft loading, if any?  The  paragraph  in  question  has  been  revised.    Aircraft  gravity  loads  are  not  anticipated within 100 feet of these walls.  Traffic surcharge should be used.  Can  you  please  provide  soil  borings  for  the  trunk  line  sewer,  shown  on  pages  CG- 308?   Soil Borings are in progress, and will not be provided prior to bid.  The 84” and 60” augured sewer lines, as shown on CG-308-CG-314, go under runway  4R 22L.  This will be a 24-hour operation, will the runway be closed, so that we can  proceed with that work?  Taxiway Y is shown to be closed for 45 days for the auger of  that 84” pipe section.  Runway  4R-22L  must  remain  open.  Operation  to  be  completed  at  night  only  when runway is closed (under runway – CDA to provide runway width and will  contact FAA for input).  We are to install the 84” pipe, shown on CG-312 and 313, through an existing parking  lot.  The sewer run has a depth of approx. 20’.  We are to install temporary barrier wall  to  keep  people  out  of  the  work  area.   Will  we  be  able  to  close  that  entire  1400’  of  parking lot or will this have to be done in stages?  If we can’t have the entire 1400’ at  once, as shown on the plans, how many feet will we have access to at one time?  The work must be done in two phases (keeping approximately half of the spaces  open in the 1400’ bay).  Per  note  3  on  CD-100  we  are  to  remove  the  existing  concrete  pavement  by  saw  cutting and removing in slabs.  The other removal pages don’t show this note.  This  site  has  a  lot  of  concrete  pavement  to  remove  and  this  is  a  very  costly  and  slow  method of removal.  Is this the entire site?  Or only isolated phases and which phases  require this?   Yes, saw cut and remove in slabs. Notes 1 through 11 on Drawing Sheet CD-100  are applicable to Drawing Sheets CD-101 through CD-05.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE RFQ   Question 1:   Is EDS filing required for all sub-consultants or only for the prime consultant?   Response:   Question 2:   Response:   Question 3:   Response:      The  Prime  is  required  to  submit  an  Online  Economic  Disclosure  Statement  and  Affidavit  (“EDS”).    Subconsultants  must  be  listed  under  the  “Retained  Parties”  section of the EDS.  In the event the Prime is a Joint Venture, each member of the  Joint Venture must submit an EDS.  There is reference to both APM (Automated People Mover) tunnels and passenger walkway  tunnels in the RFQ descriptions of work.  Will the APM stations and tunnels be designed for  both train and passenger walkway systems?  Or is it planned that the tunnels and station  space would first be passenger walkways and in the future become a train system?  Will  the design team need to design for both near-term and long-term conditions?  Yes, the design team will need to design for near-term and long-term conditions.    The  Automated  People  Mover  (“APM”)  tunnel  will  be  designed  for  both  train  and  passenger moving walkways.  Phase I will include the moving walkways but will not  implement the train system.  The train system will be implemented with Phase II of  the TAP program.  The design will need to provide for the short-term condition while  allowing for future implementation of the train system.  Will the APM train system in the tunnels be released as a separate future RFQ?  If so, when  is it anticipated that would be released?  The APM train system will be implemented under a separate procurement during the  implementation of Phase II of the TAP program.  Initiation of Phase II is dependent  upon reaching predetermined activity levels at the airport as defined in the  O’Hare  International Airport Use and Lease Agreement (“Use and Lease Agreement”).  It is  currently anticipated that it will occur after 2026.

The  organizational  chart request for Section 5 is intended to  illustrate what individuals  will be proposed in what role for the program.  Should all pages be numbered, with the exception of dividers? Or would you prefer that only  pages that fall under the page count to be numbered?   Yes.    Number  all  pages  that  count  toward  the  maximum  page  count.    The  divider  pages should only be numbered if they contain information intended to be a part of  the submittal requirements and they will count toward the page count.  Otherwise do  not number the divider pages.  Are audited financial statements required for each sub-consultant? Or is this required only  for the Prime Respondent?     a.  In the case that the audited accounts are also required for the sub-consultants, are  these only required,  if applicable? The threshold for audit exemption in the UK is  very  high  and  a  statutory  audit  has  never  been  required  to  be  carried  out  on  the  financial statements for one of the subconsultants on our team.   The  audited  financial  statements  are  for  Prime  Respondent  only.    If  the  Prime  Respondent is a joint venture, audited financial statements will be required of all the  joint venture partners.  Are corporate history and insurance requirements needed for each sub-consultant? Or is  this required only for the Prime Respondent?  It is only required for the Prime Respondent.  If the Respondent is a joint venture it  shall be required of all the joint venture partners.  Can you please provide clarity on the anticipated services for the landscape design scope?   The scope of the landscaping will depend on the design concept developed by the  shortlisted Respondents as a result of the design competition.  Since fees are not being requested at this time, is it acceptable to partially fill out Schedules  C, C-1, C-3, D, D-1, and D-3 of the request MBE / WBE documentation?  Respondents  should  submit  their  commitment  to  comply  with  the  MBE/WBE  requirements  as  stated  in the  MBE  & WBE  Special  Conditions for  Commodities  or  Services Contracts of the RFQ Document.  Schedule C-1’s and D-1’s are not needed  at the RFQ phase.  Are firms that are certified as a MBE and/or WBE with the State of Illinois eligible to count  towards the M/WBE requirements? Are firms that are certified as a MBE and/or WBE with  the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Federal Women Owned Small  Business eligible to count towards the M/WBE requirements?  MBE’s and WBE’s must be certified by either the City of Chicago or Cook County,  Illinois.   Response:   Question: 13  We  understand  that  the  fees  will  be  based  on  hourly  rates,  however  this  will  result  in  a  negative  cashflow  as  there  are  many  preliminaries  that  will  not  be  pre-funded  (RFP  and  RFQ  responses,  insurances,  registration  costs,  office  space  etc).  Will  the  city  consider  utilizing a financial mechanism to deal with this issue?  No.    The  City  will  not  compensate  Respondents  other  than  theshortlisted  Respondents.  Page 5: It is stated that the RFP submission will be considered “work for hire” and all rights  (incl. IP rights) will be transferred to the City. We do not believe that it is the intention of the  city to negotiate a contract with a respondent based on the design of another respondent?  As such we believe that the IP rights associated with the RFP response should be kept by   Question 14:      ADDENDUM NO. 3 / SPECIFICATION NO. 428915   Page 4 of 37      the respondent. Please reconsider this, in particular, as the remuneration of $50,000 will  not cover the costs of the design developed by the respondent.  Please see the revised language included in this Addendum.    Further,  it  is  not  the  intention  that  the  second-place  finisher  will  be  required  to  duplicate the winning team’s design.  As stated in the RFQ Document, the winning  team  shall  determine  an  aesthetic  and  material  palette  that  will  be  utilized  by  the  second-place  finisher  in  the  effort  to  create  a  consistency  between  the  design  elements.  It does not mean the functional or structural articulation of the designs  will be identical.   Page 9: Can you please further specify what is meant by “The Covered Entity #3 shall have  no management role whatsoever in the Respondent” (F Conflicts of Interest)? Is this related  to the project structure or to the company organization itself?  The management role is related to both the Respondent’s company organization and  the project structure.  Covered Entity #3 should have no decision-making authority  relating to either.  How does the City intend to deal with Subconsultants who are not exclusive to one team if  they are then members of multiple teams that are being selected for the RFP phase? Will  the city allow replacement of such Subconsultants at the RFP stage?  The  City  does  not  view  it  as  a  conflict  if  Subcontractors  are  members  of  multiple  teams,  although  the  various  Respondent  teams  may  view  it  as  a  conflict  amongst  themselves.  The content checklist on page 2 and the RFQ required information Pages (11-29) differ in  naming, which of these should be used for the chapter naming? In case there is a difference  in structure, which one should take precedence?  The body of the RFQ shall take precedence over the Submittal Checklist.  However,   please see the revised Submittal Checklist as Attachment B of this Addendum.  Page 21: The question “Has the firm or venture ever failed to complete any work awarded  to it? “. This is, we assume, only related to a case where a Respondent has failed to fulfil  its scope due to its own error and/or omission and not due to cancellation of the project or  similar, can you please confirm?  Correct.  This is only for projects where a Respondent has failed to fulfill its scope  due to errors, omissions, performance or negligence.  If the project  was cancelled  for other reasons, do not include it.  Page 22 The hyperlink to the EDS registration form is not valid, can you please provide an  updated  link?

Yes.  See response to Question 4 above.   A-6 We understand there will be one CMR per project component as described in figure  one or is it the intention to have multiple CMR’s within one component?   Response:   Question 15:   Response:   Question 16:   Response:   Question 17:   Response:   Question 18:   Response:   Question 19:   Response:   Question 20:   Response:   Question 21:      ADDENDUM NO. 3 / SPECIFICATION NO. 428915   Page 5 of 37      Response:   Question 22:   Response:   The TAP program will have multiple CMRs under contract to complete the work.  At  this time the division of work between CMRs has not been established.  D-2 The insurance requirement of 15M $ for each and every claim seems excessive and  might  result  in  high  overhead  costs  for  the  city  to  bear,  would  the  city  be  amenable  to  reconsidering this position?  No.  The insurance requirement will remain as stated.    Question 23:  On page 8 the “respondent” is defined as “entities that submit Proposals"". Can you please  confirm that the requirements in “Volume II – Representations and Certifications – Required  Content  “(with  the  exception  of the  licenses,  certifications  and  Schedule C  and  D forms)  should only apply to the Prime Firm rather than subcontractors/subconsultants. If this is not  the case, then this would result in a very significant number of additional pages in the RFQ  response which we do not believe is the intent.  It is only required for the Prime Respondent.  If the respondent is a Joint Venture, it  is required of all the Joint Venture partners.   Response:   Question 24:  Will the City make the Technical Requirements/Specifications noted in Section-12 page A-  63 available now?  The technical requirements will be provided to the shortlisted Respondents as part  of the RFP.  This information will not be issued to the RFQ Respondents.  The RFQ states that the contract will be a series of Construction Manager at Risk (CMR)  contracts.  Has  the  CMR  or  CMR’s  been  selected  and/or  shortlisted?  Will  the  CMR  participate in the selection of the lead architect as described in this RFQ?  The CMR’s have not been selected at this time, nor has the make-up of the evaluation  committee been determined at this time.  The Connect Chicago Alliance presented the RFQ at the pre-proposal meeting on June 27.  This group is referred to on page 8 of the RFQ, however further definition of this entity and  its role is not clear. Is the Connect Chicago Alliance the PMT for this project?  Yes.    The  Connect  Chicago  Alliance  is  the  Joint  Venture  team  providing  Program  Management Services for the TAP program as well as Capital Improvement Program  projects.  The  RFQ  states  that  certain  entities  are  not  eligible  for  this  RFQ.  Does  this  ineligibility  extend to all firms that are part of the Connect Chicago Alliance?  Yes.  It extends to members of the Joint Venture team.  Subcontractors of Connect  Chicago  Alliance  may  not  have  a  conflict  depending  on  the  specific  issue.    See  Attachment  A  –  Amended  and  Restated  Section  I.F.  Conflicts  of  Interests  and  Attachment A.1 – Conflicts Matrix.  The  scope  of  work  is  diagrammed  on  page  A-6.  This  diagram  includes  a  Civil  Scope  identified for the landside ATS station. However, this scope is not mentioned in the RFQ.  What is the intended scope of work for the landside ATS station? Is there and architectural  component of this work to be done in conjunction with the design of the OGT?  The TAP development program contemplates the potential to widen the ATS station  platform  at  Terminal  2.    The  project  is  currently  identified  as  a  component  of  the  future Tunnel Design and civil engineering work scope.  The architectural component  would be included in the procurement of this project as well.  The diagram on page A-6 indicates that the underground APM tunnel system extends to  the  west  of  the  second  planned  satellite  concourse  building  S-2;  however,  there  is  no  terminus indicated at the western end. Is there a station planned for the western end of the  APM tunnel system and does this station include an architectural design component as part  of the OGT or the Satellite Terminal scope?   Response:   Question 25:   Response:   Question 26:   Response:   Question 27:   Response:   Question 28:   Response:   Question 29:      ADDENDUM NO. 3 / SPECIFICATION NO. 428915   Page 6 of 37      Question 127:  Do C-1’s and a D-1 need to be completed as part of this response?   Response:   No.    Respondents  should  submit  their  commitment  to  comply  with  the  MBE/WBE  requirements  as  stated  in the  MBE  & WBE  Special  Conditions for  Commodities  or  Services Contracts of the RFQ Document.  Schedules C-1’s and D-1’s are not needed  at this stage.   Question 128:  Please  confirm  that  the  scope  of  this  project  includes  only  support  systems  for  the  automated people mover (APM) and the full design of the APM will be part of the Tunnel  Design project.  Phase I of the TAP program constructs the infrastructure and tunnel for the APM.  It  does  not  include  APM  systems  track  or  APM  control  systems  which  will  be  a  component of Phase II.  Is there an intention to create a co-located project team center for the PMO, CMR and Lead  Designer at the City of Chicago/CDA Administrative offices near O’Hare? If so, when would  it be available and what spaces will be available to the provider of the Lead Architectural  Design services?  No determination has been made.   Question 129:   Response:   Response:   Question 130:   Response:   Question 131:   Response:   Is there a requirement by the CDA/City of Chicago, to utilize specific software for delivery  e.g. Primavera or a project specific electronic document management system? If there is,  please advise if software & license are being provided or would need to be obtained by the  winning teams?  Yes.  Primavera 6 will be used for Scheduling Software and license will be provided  by  Respondent.    The  Program  Management  software  licenses  will  be  provided  by  CDA.  If an Ineligible Party is defined as a party that “represented the Airlines during negotiations  for the Use & Lease Agreement” (see Section F(5)),  why  was this same provision not a  part  of  previous  procurements  as  it  is  inconsistent  and  more  restrictive  than  previous  solicitations for CMAR or Program Management Office roles, yet the rationale supporting  such a prohibition appears to be identical in all three instances.  Since the prohibition was  not contained in the other procurements, perhaps its appearance solely in this RFQ is a  simple administrative oversight which can be rectified with a response to this question?  This is not an administrative oversight.  See Attachment A – Amended and Restated  Section I.F. Conflicts of Interests and Attachment A.1 – Conflicts Matrix.   Question 132:  Please clarify the intent of the phrase “represented” in Section F(5). We presume that this  phrase is intended to cover attorneys and other entities that actively negotiated with the City  on behalf of the Airlines in the lease negotiations.  If, however, a party was involved in a  limited  technical  advisory  role,  did  not  speak  for  an  Airline  from  a  business  or  legal  perspective, and did not participate in the preparation of this RFQ, we assume the party is  not an Ineligible Party?  The phrase “represented” means providing support in any capacity for the Airlines  (or any of their representatives) during the lease negotiations.     Response:   Question 133:  For any entity still considered to be an Ineligible Party due to its role as a technical advisor  to one or more of the airline Parties, may the Respondent’s SOQ contain a letter stating the  Respondent  will  terminate  its  role  as  a  technical  advisor  to  the  associated  airlines  if  the  Respondent is awarded a contract?  No.  As stated in the RFQ, entities that represented the Airlines during negotiations  for the Use & Lease Agreement are considered Ineligible Parties for consideration of  award  of  a  contract.    Terminating  its  role  as  a  current  technical  advisor  to  the  respective airlines would not remove the aforementioned conflict of interest.

Questions  & Answers:  Question  1.  Which  available  space  is the biggest? Biggest kitchen space for build-out is Michigan, but biggest  space  for guest & customer  seating  would be Jetty.  Question  2.  What is the square footage of spaces? Square footages for the spaces are shown  in the Exhibit 1 Chícago Riverwalk  Community  Marketplace Concessions  Handbook p.9 for Michigan  and p.1L for Jetty. Square footage  for kiosks in the Community Corridor  Marketplace  is being  determined. We expect  to offer a variety of sizes ranging  from L0 x 8 approximately  t2x72. Respondents  are welcome  to state minimum  square  footage  needs. Question  3.  Please  see Exhibit 1 Chicago  Riverwalk Community  Market Place  Concessions  Handbook  for renderings and  estimate  square  footage. Kiosks  for the Community  Corridor  or Marketplace  are not selected  yet and  are not available. lt ís expected that the kiosks would be much smaller that the Michígan and Jetty sites.  Sizes  for kiosks will be made  available in subsequent  RFP to qualified Respondents.  Respondents to the RFQ are welcome to provide  space requirements  for the operation  of their concession. Below ¡s a photo  of the kiosk concept the City is researching. Example  of possible kiosk  ls there a diagram  or renderings  available?  Question  4.  What are the kitchen  facilities? Limited  kitchen facilities  exíst  at Jetty only.  City would provide  connection  to power  and water  for Michigan site.  Respondents  would build out their  kitchen. Black  iron  installation  at any of the Riverwalk locations  is not expected. Vendors will prep  food at their  main location  or kitchen  and  using Riverwalk facilities  for warming  and  assembly.  Please  see Section  6 Rules  and Regulations,  subsection a.

Please  see Section  6 Rules  and Regulations,  subsection b. Liquor License  of Exhibit 1 Chicago Riverwalk Community  Marketplace  Concessions  program  Ha ndbook. Question  8.  Cost and length  of lease? The term for the Master  License  Agreement  will be no more than 36 months  with two possible  L2 month  extensions, but will not exceed  60 months  (5 years).  RFP's for the Michigan and Jetty locations may offer an immediate  36 month term for the Use Agreement. This would allow vendors t¡me to construct  the space to their specifications.  For example, a bakery or retailer will have different  needs then a bar-restaurant.  The goal would  be to allow vendors to have time to recover build out costs over the course of the agreement. As part  of the RFP process  Respondents  could propose an immediate extension  of 60 months  based on the level  of buíld-out required. Use Agreements will license concessions  to operate  on the chicago  Riverwalk. Leases will not be issued. Question  9.  Describe  Value Added  Services. Value  Added Services would be special  skills or amenities  your organization  would  offer that  benefit the Chicago  Riverwalk  or City of Chicago.

The Chicago  Riverwalk is an outdoor  public park and subject to the varying weather conditions.  The  Evaluation Committee  will review  Respondents  Financial  Statements  in order to insure that the business organization  has the financial  capacity  to operate in a high-profile  facility. Question  16.  lf the current  lnsurance  Policy  falls short of RFQ  requirements is it necessary  to upgrade the policy  for the RFQ submission  or does  the insurance  policy  get updated  after acceptance? lnsurance policies  should  not be submitted at this point.  An insurance provider  should review the Requirements and  confírm  that the Respondent  would be provided  a Certificate  of lnsurance  with the  statement requirements  for any future  Use Agreements  awarded  upon a successful  response  to a RFp for the specific  site duríng  the term of the Master  Concession  License  Agreement. Question  17.  Willthere be  a water  supply  in the kiosks? Kiosk  amenities  are being  developed currently.

Can you please  let us know if the September  5th pre-submittal  session  was recorded because  we were not aware  of the meeting until after it passed? No recording  of the September  5, pre-submittal  conference  was made.  Many of the comments  stated there are repeated  in this Addenda. Question  20.  ls there any chance  that  you would  offer  a second  guided  site visit or issue self-guided instructions for those  who were not able to attend  on Sept  5th? An additional site visit will be held at L0 a,m. on Wednesday, September  19, 2018  at the Michigan Avenue location  and followed  by the Community  Corridor  Marketplace  future site. As a result of current construction,  a site visit for the Jetty space is not available before  submittals  are due. Future RFP's for these spaces will include site visits.  See response  to euestion  3.  Question  21. I am a Woman/Minority-Owned  business  located  in the suburbs,  but I am  a City of Chicago  resident. Does the business  need to be operating in Chicago  city limits to apply for the Riverwalk  Concessions  Bid? All businesses  are welcome to submit  eualifications.

The City has several bid incentives  and programs  designed  to benefit  local businesses, small businesses and utilization thereof,  and reward  corporaté  responsibiity  and community  awareness, including  bid incentives  for apprentice  utilization, city-based businesses,  city-based manufacturers,  project-area  subcontractors, veteran/small  business joint ventures,  and the use of alternatively  powered  vehicles,  as well as the diversity  credit program.  lnformatíon  about all of the City,s programs and incentives can be found at  One program that you may not be aware of is the City's  Mentor-Protégé  Program (""Program""). Under  thís Program,  a prime contractor mentor is eligible to receive (1) a 1% bid incentive; and  (2) an additional 0.5 percent  partlcipation  credit for every one  percent  of the value of the contract performed  by a subcontractor MBEA¡/BE  protégé  (in addítion, instead  of being mentored  by the prime, can be mentored  by a first-tier subcontractor),  up to a maximum of five additional percentage  points of utilization credit.

To allow fair cost recovery, the Contractor  could substantiate a vendor’s overtime material charges for reimbursement along with  allowable  markup.  This  would  be  more  economical  for  the  City,  because  instead  of  inflating the unit cost for projected nighttime overtime charges, the City would pay only  for nighttime charges actually invoiced by the material supplier.  See  revised  Sections  5.16.24,  Method  of  Measurement  and  5.16.25,  Basis  of  Payment, as Attachment B of this Addendum.  Additionally, see revised Article  9, Proposal Pages as Attachment C of this Addendum.  There are two items numbered seven. Suggest renaming the second item as “7A” (or  with similar suffix) to preserve the existing numbering of Pay Items 8 and above.  See revised Article 9, Proposal Pages as Attachment C of this Addendum.  Where is the landside contract staging area for Contractor use, material laydown, and  subcontractor use?  There is not a designated onsite staging area. If it is determined that a staging  area would benefit the CDA and the Contractor, a staging area will be provided  to  the  Contractor.  Any  staging  area  utilized  through  the  duration  of  this  Contract  shall  be  restored  by  the  Contractor to  the  original  condition  in  which  it/they  found  the  staging  area  and  any  such  restoration  must  be  considered  incidental  to the  Contract.    Refer  to  Section 5.1.1.,  Contractor  Staging  Area,  of  the  revised  Article  5,  Scope  of  Services  and  Detailed  Specifications  as  Attachment B of this Addendum.  For onsite disposal, does Contractor need to do any  work at the stockpile location— rough grading, for example?  The Contractor must deliver the materials for onsite disposal to the designated  stockpile area and place the materials as directed by CDA.    The Contractor is  not  responsible  for  the  day  to  day  grooming  of  the  stockpiles,  however  the  Contractor  must  take  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  they  place  the  materials  in  a  safe  and  organized  manner.    Refer  to  Section  5.7.3.,  Recyclable  Materials, of the revised Article 5, Scope of Services and Detailed Specifications  as Attachment B of this Addendum.  What is the approximate percentage of daytime versus nighttime work?  Where  practical  and  in  the  opinion  of  the  Commissioner,  the  majority  of  Work  under  this  Contract  will  be  performed  during  normal  Work  hours.    Refer  to  Section  5.10,  Work  Hours,  of  the  revised  Article  5,  Scope  of  Services  and  Detailed Specifications as Attachment B of this Addendum.   Question 10:  What  is  the  location  of  airport-provided  material?  For  example,  if  the  material  is   Response:   airside, does the Contractor need to fulfill airside insurance requirements?  Airport  provided  materials  may  be  airside  or  landside.  Landside  materials  will  be  picked  up  by  the  Contractor.    Airside  materials  will  be  picked  up  by  the  Contractor and the CDA will arrange escort. Airport-provided materials shall be   ADDENDUM NO. 5 / SPECIFICATION NO. 378933   Page 2 of 12   incidental  to  the  respective  Line  Item(s)  where  applicable.  Therefore,  the  Contractor will not be required to obtain airside insurance.  Question 11:  May the Contractor use Item 41 for MBE or WBE participation?  Response:   Refer to Section 5.33, Work Not Included in Contract Line Items but Required to  Complete the Job at a Mark-Up Over Cost (Line Item 41), of the revised Article 5,  Scope  of  Services  and  Detailed  Specifications  as  Attachment  B  of  this  Addendum, “Work performed under this line item will be included in the actual  value of the contract for the purposes of MBE/WBE participation requirements.”  Under 5.7.1, disposal may be offsite “or a location determined by the Commissioner.”  What is the approximate breakdown of off-airport versus on-airport disposal by volume  and airside versus landside location?  As this is a Depends Upon Requirements (“DUR”) contract, an exact breakdown  of  disposal  cannot  be  determined.  However,  for  practical  purposes,  PCC  removals at O’Hare shall be disposed onsite for recycling, and PCC removals at  Midway, and miscellaneous spoils from both airports shall be disposed offsite.  Refer  to  Section  5.7.3.,  Recyclable  Materials,  of  the  revised  Article  5,  Scope  of  Services and Detailed Specifications as Attachment B of this Addendum.  Please give more information on the design of Item 33 Install Concrete Retaining Wall  System.  See  revised  Section  5.26,  Installation  of  PCC  Retaining Wall  System  (Line Item  33), as Attachment B of this Addendum.   Question 12:   Response:   Question 13:   Response:   Question 14:  Will safety personnel be required to be onsite at all times during working operations?    Response:   If so, how are we to be compensated for this?  Yes.  However, a Contractor Laborer or Foreman with OSHA certification may be  assigned  as  the  safety  person  to  ensure  personnel  are  in  compliance  with  OSHA safety standards.   Question 15:  Will  a  full-time  quality  control  technician  be  required  to  be  onsite  at  all  times  during  work operations, or are they only required to be onsite when the work necessitates the  need for specific testing?  If they are required to be onsite full time, how are we to be  compensated for this?  If Safety and QC are required fulltime, how are we to quantify  the amount of work which we will be given each year to ensure we have enough QC  or Safety coverage?  A  Contractor  Quality  Control  Technician  will  only  be  required  for  specific  testing as referenced in Section 5.15, Quality Control Program as Attachment B  of this Addendum.  If  Safety  and  QC  are  required  fulltime,  how  are  we  to  quantify  the  amount  of  work  which we will be given each year to ensure we have enough QC or Safety coverage?  See responses to Questions 14 and 15 above.  Can an allowance item be added to the contract to allow for proper compensation of a  full time QC or Safety Representative?  No.   Response:  Question 17:   Response:   Response:   Question 16:            END OF ADDENDUM NO. 5     CITY OF CHICAGO   DEPARTMENT OF PROCUREMENT SERVICES        JAMIE L.

Production Paving Adjustments to the Concrete Mixture Proportions  Production paving concrete mixture proportions must be adjusted to achieve uniformity in the properties of fresh  concrete, to maintain concrete workability, and to provide the specified properties for the fresh and in place concrete.   Field adjustments to the approved concrete mixture as established by the Contractor’s QC laboratory testing are  permitted without requiring a new submittal for the concrete mixture proportions as follows:   1.   Individual aggregate proportions may be adjusted as necessary and approved by the Commissioner.   2.  As necessary, cementitious materials may be increased by up to 10% by weight of the approved mixture   proportions.  Cementitious material content must not be reduced from the approved mixture proportions.   3.  As necessary, cement may be replaced with the approved SCM in an amount not to exceed 10% of the original   SCM mass.  When applicable, the Contractor’s mitigation plan for reactive aggregates must be re-evaluated.   4.  As necessary, any SCM may be approved with the approved cement.  When applicable, the Contractor’s mitigation   plan for reactive aggregation must be re-evaluated.   5.  Quantities of admixtures may be adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.   6.  Field adjustment for water is permitted provided that the water-cementitious materials ratio does not exceed the   ratio for the approved concrete mixture and is not less than that listed in Paragraph 3.01.C.   7.  For truck mixed concrete, additional water may be added only once to adjust the workability of concrete, provided  the approved water-to-cementitious materials ratio is not exceeded.  The maximum amount to be added must be  adjusted based upon the volume of concrete already discharged.  The drum or blades must be turned a minimum  of 30 additional revolutions at mixing speed after water addition.   Water addition to the concrete by spraying in front of and behind the paving equipment is not allowed.   Limitations on Mixing and Placing   5.16.20.8.  No concrete will be mixed, placed or finished when natural daylight is insufficient, unless an adequate and approved  artificial lighting system is provided.   Cold Weather:  Unless authorized in writing by the Commissioner, and a cold weather paving plan is submitted 21 days  prior to mixing and concreting operations, operations must be discontinued when air temperature in the shade and  away from artificial heat reaches 40°F and must not be resumed until air temperature in the shade and away from  artificial heat reaches 35°F.  The cold weather plan must incorporate recommendations of ACI 306 – Cold Weather  Concreting.   The Contractor must submit a request in writing to the Commissioner that the temperature requirements be waived in  event that cold weather paving is necessary.   In addition, a cold weather paving plan must be submitted in advance to address all procedural changes to be  employed to ensure that all Work will meet the required acceptance criteria.  The Contractor must submit a detailed  plan on means and methods to be utilized to meet the requirements of this Section.   The aggregate must be free of ice, snow, and frozen lumps before entering the mixer.  The temperature of the mixed  concrete must not be less than 50° F at the time of placement.  Concrete must not be placed on frozen material nor will  frozen aggregates be used in the concrete mix.   When paving is authorized during cold weather, water and/or the aggregates may be heated to not more than 150°F.   The apparatus used must heat the mass uniformly and must be arranged to preclude the possible occurrence of  overheated areas which might be detrimental to the finished materials.   Hot Weather:  During periods of hot weather, when the daily air temperature exceeds 85° F, a hot weather paving plan  that incorporates the following precautions must be submitted 21 days before any concrete being placed in hot  weather.  The hot weather paving plan must incorporate applicable recommendations of ACI 305 - Hot Weather  Concreting, and other industry accepted procedures, to mitigate any detrimental results from hot weather concrete  placement.   The concrete must be placed at the coolest temperature practicable, and in no case will the temperature of the  concrete placed exceed 90° F.  The aggregates and/or mixing water must be cooled as necessary to maintain the  concrete temperature at or not more than the specified maximum.

The  joint  venture  may  receive  MBE  or  WBE  credit  for  work  performed  by  the  MBE or WBE joint venture partner(s) equal to the value of work performed by   Page 4 of 16      03/2015            SMALL ORDERS MBE & WBE SPECIAL CONDITIONS   the MBE or WBE with its own forces for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the  work.   Additionally,  if  employees  of  the  joint  venture  entity  itself  (as  opposed  to  employees of the MBE or WBE partner) perform the work, then the value of the  work may be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals at a rate equal to the  MBE or WBE firm’s percentage of participation in the joint venture as described  in Schedule B.     The  Chief  Procurement  Officer  may  also  count  the  dollar  value  of  work  subcontracted to  other MBEs  and WBEs.   Work  performed  by  the forces  of  a  non-certified  joint  venture  partner  shall  not  be  counted  toward  the  Contract  Specific Goals.     Schedule B:  MBE/WBE Affidavit of Joint Venture    c.            Where  the  bidder’s  Compliance  Plan  includes  the  participation  of any  MBE  or  WBE as a joint venture partner, the bidder must submit with its bid a Schedule  B  and  the  proposed  joint  venture  agreement.    These  documents  must  both  clearly  evidence  that  the  MBE  or  WBE  joint  venture  partner(s)  will  be  responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work to be performed, and that  the  MBE’s  or  WBE’s  responsibilities  and  risks  are  proportionate  to  its  ownership  percentage.    The  proposed  joint  venture  agreement  must  include  specific details related to:  i.  of the costs of insurance and bonding;  ii.  Work  items  to  be  performed  by  the  MBE’s  or  WBE’s  own  forces  and/or  work to be performed by employees of the newly formed joint venture entity;  iii.  Work  items  to  be  performed  under  the  supervision  of  the  MBE  or  WBE  joint venture partner; and  iv.  operative personnel to the performance of the contract.   The parties’ contributions of capital, personnel, and equipment and share    The  MBE’s  or  WBE’s  commitment  of  management,  supervisory,  and      NOTE:    Vague,  general  descriptions  of  the  responsibilities  of  the  MBE  or  WBE  joint  venture partner do not provide any basis for awarding credit.  For example, descriptions  such  as  “participate  in  the  budgeting  process,”  “assist  with  hiring,”  or  “work  with  managers to improve customer service” do not identify distinct, clearly defined portions  of  the  work.    Roles  assigned  should  require  activities  that  are  performed  on  a  regular,  recurring basis rather than as needed.  The roles must also be pertinent to the nature of  the business for which credit is being sought.  For instance, if the scope of work required  by  the  City  entails  the  delivery  of goods  or  services  to  various  sites  in  the  City,  stating  that the MBE or WBE joint venture partner will be responsible for the performance of all  routine maintenance and all repairs required to the vehicles used to deliver such goods  or services is pertinent to the nature of the business for which credit is being sought.   4.  APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF MENTOR PROTÉGÉ AGREEMENT     Any applications for City approval of a Mentor Protégé agreement must be included  with the bid.  If the application is not approved, the bidder must show that it has made  good faith efforts to meet the contract specific goals.        03/2015      Page 5 of 16            SMALL ORDERS MBE & WBE SPECIAL CONDITIONS   5.  COUNTING MBE/WBE PARTICIPATION TOWARD THE CONTRACT SPECIFIC   GOALS     Refer  to  this  section  when  preparing  the  MBE/WBE  compliance  plan  and  completing  Schedule D-1 for guidance on what value of the participation by MBEs and WBEs will be  counted  the  stated  Contract  Specific  Goals.  The  “Percent  Amount  of  Participation” depends on whether and with whom a MBE or WBE subcontracts out any  portion of its work and other factors.     toward   Firms  that  are  certified  as  both  MBE  and  WBE  may  only  be  listed  on  a  bidder’s  compliance  plan  as  either  a  MBE  or  a  WBE  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  Contract  Specific  Goals.    For  example,  a  firm  that  is  certified  as  both  a  MBE  and  a  WBE  may  only  be  listed  on  the  bidder’s  compliance  plan  under  one  of  the  categories,  but  not  both.  Only  Payments  made  to  MBE  and  WBE  firms  that  meet  BOTH  the  Commercially  Useful  Function  and  Area  of  Specialty  requirements  above  will  be  counted toward the Contract Specific Goals.     a.   Only expenditures to firms that perform a Commercially Useful Function as   defined above may count toward the Contract Specific Goals.     i.  The  CPO  will  determine  whether  a  firm  is  performing  a  commercially  useful function by evaluating the amount of work subcontracted, whether  the  amount  the  firm  is  to  be  paid  under  the  contract  is  commensurate  with  the  work  it  is  actually  performing  and  the  credit  claimed  for  its  performance of the work, industry practices, and other relevant factors.   ii.  A  MBE  or  WBE  does  not  perform  a  commercially  useful  function  if  its  participation  is  only  required  to  receive  payments  in  order  to  obtain  the  appearance  of  MBE  or  WBE  participation.    The  CPO  may  examine  similar  commercial  transactions,  particularly  those  in  which  MBEs  or  WBEs do not participate, to determine whether non MBE and non WBE  firms  perform  the  same  function  in  the  marketplace  to  make  a  determination.     iii.  Indications that a MBE or WBE is not performing a commercially useful  function  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  labor  shifting  and  equipment  sharing  or  leasing  arrangements  with  the  prime  contractor  or  a  first  tier  subcontractor.   b.  Only  the  value  of  the  dollars  paid  to  the  MBE  or  WBE  firm  for  work  that  it  performs  in  its  Area  of  Specialty  in  which  it  is  certified  counts  toward  the  Contract Specific Goals.     c.  For Maintenance, installation, repairs or inspection, if the MBE or WBE performs   the work itself:   i.  100%  of  the  value  of  work  actually  performed  by  the  MBE’s  or  WBE’s  own  forces  shall  be  counted  toward  the  Contract  Specific  Goals,  including  the  cost  of  supplies  and  materials  purchased  or  equipment  leased  by  the  MBE  or  WBE  from  third  parties  or  second  tier  subcontractors  in  order  to  perform  its  (sub)contract  with  its  own  forces  (except  supplies  and  equipment  the  MBE  or  WBE  subcontractor  purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate). 0% of the  value of work at the project site that a MBE or WBE subcontracts to  a non-certified firm counts toward the Contract Specific Goals.     03/2015      Page 6 of 16         SMALL ORDERS MBE & WBE SPECIAL CONDITIONS   excessive  as  compared  with  fees  customarily  allowed  for  similar  services.   6.  REGULATIONS GOVERNING REDUCTIONS TO OR WAIVER OF MBE/WBE   GOALS   The following Regulations set forth the standards to be used in determining whether or  not a reduction or waiver of the MBE/WBE commitment goals of a particular contract is  appropriate.    If  a  bidder  determines  that  it  is  unable  to  meet  the  MBE  and/or  WBE  percentage on a City of Chicago contract, a written request for the reduction or waiver of  the commitment must be included in the bid or proposal.    The written request for reduction or waiver from the commitment must be in the form of a  signed  petition  for  grant  of  relief  from  the  MBE/WBE  percentages  submitted  on  the  bidder's  letterhead,  and  must  demonstrate  that  all  required  efforts  as  set  forth  in  this  document  were  taken  to  secure  eligible  Minority  and  Women  Business  Enterprises  to  meet  the  commitments.    The  Chief  Procurement  Officer  or  designee  shall  determine  whether the request for the reduction or waiver will be granted.    All  bidders  will  be  considered  responsive  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  these  Regulations  if,  at  the  time  of  bid,  it  submits  a  waiver  request  and  all  supporting  documentation that adequately addresses the conditions for waiver of MBE/WBE goals,  including proof of notification to assist agencies except:     1)  Bidders responding to  Request for  Proposals  (RFPs)  who  have  been  identified  as  a  sort  listed  candidate  and/or  a  prospective  awardee  will  be  given  a  designated  time  allowance, but no more than fourteen (14) calendar days to submit to the Department of  Procurement  Services  complete  documentation  the  conditions for waiver described herein; and    2)  Bidders  responding  to  Request  for  Information  and  or  Qualifications  (RFI/RFQs)  deemed  by  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer  or  authorized  designee  to  be  the  most  responsive  and  responsible  shall  submit  documentation  that  adequately  addresses  the  conditions for waiver described herein during negotiations.     Failure  to  submit  documentation  sufficient  to  support  the  waiver  request  will  cause  the  bid/proposal  to  be  found  non-responsive  by  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer,  and  the  bid/proposal  will  be  rejected.    In  such  cases  the  remedies  to  be  taken  by  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  forfeiture  of  bid  deposit;  negotiating  with  the  next  lowest  bidder;  or  re-advertising  the  bid/proposal.  All bidders must submit all required documents at the time of bid opening  to expedite the contract award.   that  adequately  addresses   a.  Direct / Indirect Participation   Each  of  the  following  elements  must  be  present  in  order  to  determine  whether  or  not  such a reduction or waiver is appropriate.    i.  The  bidder  has  documented  the  unsuccessful  solicitation  for  either  subcontractors  or  joint  venture  partners  of at  least  50%  (or  at  least five  when there are more than eleven certified firms in the commodity area)  of  the  appropriate  certified  MBE/WBE  firms  to  perform  any  direct  or   03/2015      Page 8 of 16         SMALL ORDERS MBE & WBE SPECIAL CONDITIONS   indirect  work  identified  or  related  to  the  advertised  bid/proposal.  Documentation must include but is not necessarily limited to:   1.   A  detailed  statement  of  efforts  to  identify  and  select  portions  of  work identified in the bid solicitation for subcontracting to certified  MBE/WBE firms;   2.   A listing of all MBE/WBE firms contacted that includes:   a.  Name,  address,   telephone  number  and  email  of   MBE/WBE firms solicited;  b.  Date and time of contact;  c.  Method  of  contact  (written,  telephone,  transmittal  of   facsimile documents, email, etc.)   3.  Copies  of   letters  or  any  other  evidence  of  mailing  substantiates outreach to MBE/WBE vendors that includes:   that   a.  Project identification and location;  b.  Classification/commodity  of  work   quotations were sought;   items   for  which   c.  Date,  item  and  location  for  acceptance  of  subcontractor   bid proposals;   d.  Detailed  statement  which  summarizes  direct  negotiations  with  appropriate  MBE/WBE  firms  for  specific  portions  of  the  work  and  indicates  why  negotiations  were  unsuccessful;   e.  Affirmation   that  Good  Faith  Efforts  have  been   demonstrated by:  i.   choosing subcontracting opportunities likely to achieve   MBE/WBE goals;    ii.  not  imposing  any  limiting  conditions  which  were  not   mandatory for all subcontractors;     iii.  providing  notice  of  subcontracting  opportunities  to  M/WBE  firms  and  assist  agencies  at  least  five  (5)  business days in advance of the initial bid due date.    4.  Documentation  may  also  include  efforts  to  utilize  the  Department  of  Procurement  Services’  M/WBE  for  purposes  of  advertising subcontracting opportunities appropriate for MBEs and  WBEs. The M/WBE forum is located at:    forum   https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/MWBEForum/forums/list.page.   OR     ii.  Subcontractor  participation  will  be  deemed  excessively  costly  when  the  MBE/WBE subcontractor proposal exceeds the average price quoted by  more  than  twenty  percent  (20%).    In  order  to  establish  that  a  subcontractor’s quote is excessively costly, the bidder must provide the  following information:   1.  A  detailed  statement  of  the  work  identified  for  MBE/WBE  participation for which the bidder asserts the MBE/WBE quote(s)  were excessively costly (in excess of 20% higher).   2.   A listing of all potential subcontractors contacted for a quotation   on that work item;   3.   Prices  quoted  for  the  subcontract  in  question  by  all  such   potential subcontractors for that work item.   03/2015      Page 9 of 16      SMALL ORDERS MBE & WBE SPECIAL CONDITIONS   7.  PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE BID COMPLIANCE  A bid may be rejected as non-responsive if it fails to submit one or more of the following  with its bid demonstrating its Good Faith Efforts to meet the Contract Specific Goals by  reaching out to MBEs and WBEs to perform work on the contract:     A.  An  MBE/WBE  compliance  plan  demonstrating  how  the  bidder  plans  to  meet  the   Contract Specific Goals; and/or   B.  A request for reduction or waiver of the Contract Specific Goals in accordance with   Section 2-92-450 of the MCC.       Only compliance plans utilizing MBE and WBE firms that meet BOTH the  Commercially Useful Function and Area of Specialty requirements will be counted  toward the Contract Specific Goals.     The  following  Schedules  and  described  documents  constitute  the  bidder's  MBE/WBE  proposal, and must be submitted in accordance with the guidelines stated:   a.  Schedule C-1: Letter of Intent from MBE/WBE to Perform as Subcontractor,   Supplier and/or Consultant.    The bidder must submit the appropriate Schedule C-1 with the bid for each MBE  and WBE included on the Schedule D-1.  The City encourages subcontractors to  utilize  the  electronic  fillable  format  Schedule  C-1,  which  is  available  at  the  Department  of  Procurement  Services  website,  http://cityofchicago.org/forms.  Suppliers  must  submit  the  Schedule  C-1  for  Suppliers,  first  tier  subcontractors  must  submit  a  Schedule  C-1  for  Subcontractors  to  the  Prime  Contractor  and  second or lower tier subcontractors must submit a Schedule C-1 for second tier  Subcontractors.  Each Schedule C-1 must be executed by each MBE and WBE  and  accurately  detail  the  work  to  be  performed  by  the  MBE  or  WBE  and  the  agreed upon rates/prices.  Each Schedule C must also include a separate sheet  as an attachment on which the MBE or WBE fully describes its proposed scope  of  work,  including  a  description  of  the  commercially  useful  function  being  performed by the MBE or WBE in its Area of Specialty. If a facsimile copy of the  Schedule C-1 has been submitted with the bid, an executed original Schedule C- 1  must  be  submitted  by  the  bidder  for  each  MBE  and  WBE  included  on  the  Schedule D-1 within five business days after the date of the bid opening.     Failure to submit a completed Schedule C-1 in accordance with this section shall  entitle the City to deem the bid/proposal non-responsive and therefore reject the  bid/proposal.   b.  Letters of Certification.   A copy of each proposed MBE/WBE firm's current Letter of Certification from the  City of Chicago or Cook County, Illinois, must be submitted with the bid/proposal.   All Letters of Certification issued by the City of Chicago and Cook County include  a  statement  of  the  MBE/WBE  firm's  Area  of  Specialty.

I understand the vital role played by businesses, particularly small neigh- borhood enterprises, in making Chicago the world class city it is. We are committed to creating  an environment that provides support to all types of business owners, allows innovators the room  they need to flourish, and encourages healthy and prosperous communities.  I am extremely proud of all that has been accomplished since 2011. In response to issues raised  by the small business community, we have created the one-stop-shop Small Business Center, cut our total number of  business licenses from 117 to 40, and moved many of our processes online. We have encouraged innovation through  the Emerging Business Permit and by reducing fees for over 10,000 business owners. Our community groups have  expanded their connection to neighborhood businesses by offering free resources and services to tens of thousands  of Chicagoans. As part of our commitment to invest in all areas of the city, we have granted over $11 million to fund  neighborhood businesses in the South and West Sides.   All Chicagoans should look with pride at our flourishing business community, but I am not satisfied. There is more  we can do to support business growth. Therefore, I am committing to a series of initiatives to help small business and  entrepreneurs thrive:             • A reduced “start-up” fee for new business licenses that cuts the cost in half • An expansion of the sidewalk café season to allow for full year operations • The publication of a license issuance clock to increase transparency and accountability • The creation of a pop-up permit  •  A reduction of the inspection burden through new checklists, cross-training, increased technology, and the   elimination of unnecessary regulations and inspections.   To all of our entrepreneurs, the City is your partner. Chicago has always been and will continue to be open for business.                                                          Sincerely,  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  Dear Chicagoans,  Chicago’s  business  community  is  thriving,  with  over  60,000  active  business  licenses.  As  the   Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP), it is my job to   support businesses across the city and I am dedicated to doing everything possible to help small  business owners achieve their dreams.   Through the support of Mayor Emanuel, my Department has spearheaded numerous initiatives to   support the business community of Chicago. However, we are not alone -- this report features   the efforts undertaken by all City Departments and community organizations, from the Department of Public Health’s  efforts to improve inspection success rates, to the Department of Buildings’ work to reduce the building code burden,  to the business grants offered by the Department of Planning and Development to ignite business growth in every   neighborhood, to the incredible work done by our partner agencies in the community. Chicago is all in for small  business.   Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and our communities thrive because of its businesses. In this report, we highlight  some of the small business owners that make our communities extraordinary. The entrepreneurial experience provides  context for everything we do at BACP, and we are excited for the new initiatives that will make it even easier to launch  and grow your business in Chicago.   Thanks to all of the City Departments and community organizations that made this report possible by working tirelessly  to support Chicago’s businesses. More importantly, thanks to Chicago’s small business owners.  Your innovation, hard  work, and entrepreneurial spirit are what make this city great. We have your back and are committed to continuing to  create a welcoming, supportive, and strong business environment.                                                         Sincerely,  Commissioner Rosa Escareno  Table of Contents  The priority areas listed below have provided direction to all our  past initiatives and will shape our future endeavors. This report  highlights the key initiatives from BACP, City Departments, and  community  partners  within  the  four  areas  that  have  ensured  a  thriving small business ecosystem in Chicago.      PRIORITY AREAS  Promoting Innovation  and Entrepreneurship                    PAGES          1  Reducing Red Tape                    5  Increasing Support  Resources                            9  Expanding Access  to Capital                                     13  Showcased throughout the report are testimonials from Chicago  business  owners  and  the  community  groups  that  have  helped  them succeed. The report also charts Mayor Emanuel’s commit- ment  to  continue  our  progress  in  the  coming  months,  through  the implementation of specific initiatives and the achievement of  long-term goals.   PROMOTING INNOVATION  AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  Chicago  is  fortunate  to  have  many  entrepreneurs  looking  to  take  their  creative  and   innovative ideas and turn them into prosperous businesses. We are committed to ensuring  a regulatory environment that is welcoming to innovation and growth and open to new  business ideas. We encourage Chicago’s many burgeoning entrepreneurs to invest in their  ideas and we will work together to make your concept a reality.   EMERGING BUSINESS PERMIT We know that the private sector can innovate faster than any government. That is why we  created  the  Emerging  Business  Permit  to  license  new  businesses  that  do  not  fall under our existing regulatory framework. Instead of saying “no,” we find  a  way  to  make  it  work.  Innovators  such  as  Juana  Ryan,  a  mobile  boutique   operator, have used this tool to succeed in Chicago.  THE CITY   HAS MY BACK  The consultants were enthusiastic and supportive about my  business venture and made me feel that they truly cared about  the success of StellaLily. I am truly grateful that I chose to    open a new business in Chicago.   Juana Ryan, StellaLily  1  ““””PROMOTING INNOVATION  AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  START-UPS Starting a business is tough! We are here to support entrepreneurs as they work tirelessly to launch their business.    Home-Based Businesses Many of the world’s most successful businesses began in the home. Chicago understands that innovators need the  freedom to test out certain ideas before investing in a brick and mortar location. In 2017, we reformed the home-  occupation license to remove limitations and prohibitions, making it easier to launch a business out of your home and  partner with brick and mortar storefronts.  	  	  4 2,600 home-based businesses can now operate under modernized regulations 4	Home-based business activity increased by 34% in 2017   Restaurant Start-Up Program Chicago is a global destination for anyone who loves food, and we intend to grow that reputation by making it easier  to open a restaurant. Chicago has made a significant effort to reduce the confusion and complexity related to this pro- cess. The Restaurant Start-Up Program, spearheaded by the Department of Public Health, is designed make the start-up  process easier by creating a hub of information, reducing wait times through a team-based approach, reducing the  number of inspection visits while helping restaurants pass their inspections, and making the rules easier to understand.  	  4		Due to the Restaurant Start-Up Program, inspection passage rates for restaurants have    increased by 133%, and restaurants are opening 45 days earlier  2  REDUCING RED TAPE  Sometimes government just needs to get out of the way. Chicago has the hardest working  entrepreneurs in the world, and City Hall is committed to making it easier to access City   services and secure the necessary licenses and permits. We are dedicated to modernizing  City processes and making interactions with your City government stress-free.  ONE STOP SHOP BUSINESS CENTER Launched  in  2013,  the  Small  Business  Center  (SBC)  is  a  “One  Stop  Shop”  for  business   owners  to  have  all  their  business  needs  met  in  one  place.  Partnerships  between  the   Departments  of  Business  Affairs  and  Consumer  Protection,  Buildings,  Public  Health,   Procurement, and Planning and Development allow an entrepreneur to streamline all their   interactions with City government. Additionally, applicants can receive free business, legal,  and financial counseling services from outside experts at the same location they meet with  City officials.   	  	  4  14,400 applicants have received a Health Consultation    at the SBC, eliminating a step in the licensing process  4  2,600 entrepreneurs have received free 1:1 counseling at the SBC  The team at the City helped make the process far less challenging.  I always felt like they were    on my side and working hard to make sure I would succeed in getting the shop open  I LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CITY TEAM   AND WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED.
