16,https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/LGBTQHealth/CDPH_2017LGBT_Report_r6a.pdf,Success,Success,90,10,Not a fillable PDF.,"Executive Summary  In both adolescents and adults, research has found that sexual and gender minorities are  more likely to engage in risky behaviors than their heterosexual and/or cisgender peers. Policies and cultural norms that stigmatize and exclude sexual and gender minorities can  foster these behaviors and ultimately lead to negative health effects for individuals and  population health disparities specific to these communities. It is of the utmost importance  to understand and address the unique health needs of sexual and gender minorities.  For the first time, the Chicago Department of Public Health  (CDPH) is presenting data to describe sexual and gender minority  health status for lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) youth, LGB adults  and transgender adults in Chicago. These new data are critical  as stakeholders continue to implement the citywide health  improvement plan, Healthy Chicago 2.0, launched in 2016. Sexual  and gender minorities are identified as a priority population for  several overall goals of the plan.   ever population estimates and demographic profile of the overall  LGBT population in Chicago. Almost 146,000 (7.5%) of Chicago  adults identify as LGBT. These long sought after numbers provide  a new perspective on the scope and contribution of the LGBT  community to Chicago as a whole.   Data from the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the  CDPH Healthy Chicago Survey (HCS) provide local information  on a wide range of health issues among LGB youth and adults. In  this document, easy-to-read charts and tables are provided to  glean differences or similarities between (1) males and females  who identify as LGB compared to their heterosexual peers, (2)  between males and females who identify as LGB and (3) between  LGB and heterosexual identified individuals overall.   Importantly, HCS data are able to describe a limited number of  broad health outcomes comparing the health of transgender  adults to their cisgender peers. Small numbers of transgender  respondents to the HCS survey limit our ability to report on the  array of indicators that are included for LGB in this report. We  acknowledge that the transgender data presented in this report  are a modest start towards a true understanding of the needs of  the transgender population. CDPH remains committed to serving  transgender and gender non-conforming residents and will  continued to work with our partners to identify new resources to  conduct more inclusive research on the transgender and gender  non-conforming populations of Chicago.  Among the most important milestones of this report are the first-  2  Key findings of this report emphasize both promising resiliency  and the challenges that remain in achieving health equity.  •  Older LGB and older heterosexuals report similar levels  of overall well being to each other. This is in contrast to  differences that exist among young adults in both groups.  •   •   Similarly, older LGB adults are far less likely to report  psychological distress than younger adults.  Lesbian and bisexual females are more likely to be current  smokers than heterosexual females at all life stages.  •  Male gay and bisexual youth report alarmingly high rates of   substance use, particularly heroin and prescription drugs.  •   Transgender and gender non-conforming adults are less  likely to report good overall health and far more likely to  report psychological distress than their cisgender peers.    While LGB youth do exhibit higher rates of health risk  behaviors than their heterosexual peers for many indicators,  the differences do not persist strongly into adulthood. These  particular findings may reflect a resilient effect among many  in the sexual minority communities in the face of stigma and  social exclusion. Continuing efforts to promote health and  well-being among transgender persons must be combined  with policies and actions to sharply reduce the social and  economic hardships they face.

Tables show the survey question used for each indicator, the  data source and the year of the data. Point estimates and 95%  confidence intervals are presented. Colored boxes indicate  significant difference between LGB and Heterosexual based on  non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals.  Tables present the actual number of people who responded  and the weighted percentage. The weighted percentage is  an adjusted statistic that takes into account the respondent  relative to the survey population.  Youth: Those who answered ‘not sure’ are reported to give a  picture of how they compare to other groups. These students,  however, are excluded from analysis used for the charts.  Adults: Adults are divided into two groups, ages 18-44 and 45+  Charts  Data are weighted percentages and associated confidence intervals.  Summary statements for each indicator describe the results  shown in the graphs. There are separate indicators for youth  and adults, with adults divided into ages 18-44 and 45+  unless otherwise noted. Each indicator is grouped by gender  and total unless otherwise noted, with different colored bars  representing sexual identity.    Gender: Results are shown based on whether an individual  selected male or female.   Sexual identity: Respondents who reported that they identified  as lesbian, gay or bisexual are categorized as LGB. Those  who identified as straight or heterosexual are categorized  as Heterosexual. Those who answered ‘not sure” (YRBS) or  ‘something else’ or ‘other’ (HCS) were excluded from analysis.  14  Healthy Chicago databook","[{'docTokenBegin': 0, 'docTokenEnd': 1, 'tokenBegin': 0, 'tokenEnd': 1, 'text': 'Executive', 'characterOffsetBegin': 0, 'characterOffsetEnd': 9, 'ner': 'TITLE'}]"

A:  The web link for the Online EDS is https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/EDSWeb   Q:  How do I get help?   A:   If there is a question mark on a page or next to a field, click on the question mark for help filling out  the page or field.  You may also consult the User Manual and the Training Videos available on the  left menu.   Q:  Why do I have to submit an EDS?   A:  The  Economic  Disclosure  Statement  (EDS)  is  required  of  applicants  making  an  application  to  the  City for action requiring City Council, City department or other City agency approval.  For example,  all  bidders  seeking  a  City  contract  are  required  to  submit  an  EDS.    Through  the  EDS,  applicants  make  disclosures  required  by  State  law  and  City  ordinances  and  certify  compliance  with  various  laws  and  ordinances.    An  EDS  is  also required  of  certain  parties  related to  the  applicant, such  as  owners and controlling parties.   Q:  Who is the Applicant?   A:  “Applicant”  means  any  entity  or  person  making  an  application  to  the  City  for  action  requiring  City  Council  or  other  City  agency  approval.    The  applicant  does  not  include  owners  and  parent   4 | P a g e                                                            Addendum No. 1  Specification No. 704315   companies.   Q:  Who is the Disclosing Party?   A:  “Disclosing Party” means any entity or person submitting an EDS.  This includes owners and parent   companies.   Q:  What is an entity or legal entity?   A:  “Entity’ or ‘Legal Entity” means a legal entity (for example, a corporation, partnership, joint venture,   limited liability company or trust).   Q:  What is a person for purposes of the EDS?   A:  “Person” means a human being.   Q:  Who must submit an EDS?   A.  An EDS must be submitted in any of the following three circumstances:   Applicants:   An Applicant must always file this EDS.  If the Applicant is a legal  entity, state the full name of that legal entity.  If the Applicant is a  person acting on his/her own behalf, state his/her name.   Entities  holding an  interest:   Whenever  a  legal  entity  has  a  beneficial  interest  (E.  G.  direct  or  indirect ownership) of more than 7.5% in the Applicant, each such  legal entity must file an EDS on its own behalf.   Controlling  entities:   Whenever  a  Disclosing  Party  is  a  general  partnership,  limited  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  limited  liability  partnership  or  joint  venture  that  has  a  general  partner,  managing  member,  manager  or  other  entity  the  day-to-day  management of the Disclosing Party, that entity must also file an  EDS  on  its  own  behalf.    Each  entity  with  a  beneficial  interest  of  more than 7.5% in the controlling entity must also file an EDS on  its own behalf.   that  can  control      Q:  What information is needed to submit an EDS?   A:  The information contained in the Preparation Checklist for EDS submission.   Q:  I don’t have a user ID & password.  Can I still submit an Online EDS?   A:  No. You must register and create a user ID and password before submitting an Online EDS.   Q:  What information is needed to request a user ID & password for Online EDS?    A:  The information contained in the Preparation Checklist for Registration is needed to request a login   for the Online EDS.   Q:  I  already  have  a  username  and  password  from  another  City  web  site  (City  Web  Portal,  Department of Construction and Permits, Department of Consumer Services, etc.). Can I log-  5 | P a g e                                                            Addendum No. 1  Specification No. 704315   in the Online EDS with that account?   A:  Usually  not.    The  Online  EDS  uses  a  user  ID  and  password  system  that  is  shared  by  the  Public  Vehicle  Advertising  and Water  Payment  web  sites.  You  may  use  a  username  and  password  from  those  sites  by  answering  “Yes”  to  “Is  this  an  existing  City  of  Chicago  user  ID?”  when  registering.  Other usernames and passwords will not be automatically recognized. However, you may choose to  create an identical username for the Online EDS if it is not already taken.   Q:  I don’t have an email address.  How do I submit an Online EDS?   A:  You cannot get an account to submit an online EDS without an email address. If you need an e-mail  address,  we  suggest  that  you  use  a  free  internet  email  provider  such  as  www.hotmail.com  or  www.yahoo.com or rnail.google.com to open an account. The City does not endorse any particular  free internet email provider. Public computers are available at all Chicago Public Library branches.   Q:  I forgot my user ID. Can I register again?   A:  No. If you are the EDS Captain of your organization, please contact the Department of Procurement  Services  at  312-744-4900.  If  you  are  an  EDS  team  member,  contact  your  EDS  Captain,  who  can  look up your user ID.   Q:  Who is the EDS Captain?   A:  The  EDS  Captain  is  a  person  who  performs  certain  administrative  functions  for  an  organization  which  files  an  EDS.    Each  organization  registered  with  the  Online  EDS  has  at  least  one  EDS  Captain. There may be co-captains, who are all equal.  EDS Captains approve new users, change  contact  information  for  an  organization,  and  de-active  accounts  of  employees  who  have  left  the  organization. Please see the User Manual for more information.   Q: Why do we need EDS Captains?   A:  The  Online  EDS  is  designed  to  be  a  self-service  web  application  which  allows  those  doing  or  seeking to do business with the City to perform as many routine functions as possible without City  intervention.  Because  many  organizations  have  multiple  staff  filing  an  EDS,  the  EDS  Captain  role  allows those organizations to self-manage the contact information and users.   Q:  Who is the EDS team?   A:  The  EDS  team  for  an  organization  is  everyone  who  is  registered  to  file  an  EDS  on  behalf  of  the   organization.   Q:  I forgot my password.  What should I do?   A:  To retrieve a temporary  password, click the “Forgot  your password?”  link on the login page.  Enter  your  user  ID  that  you  provided  when  you  registered  your  account.  The  system  will  automatically  generate a temporary password and send it to you.  When you log-in with your temporary password,  you will be asked to create a new password.   Q:  How do I complete an Online EDS?   A:  Click  on  “Create  New”  after  logging  in.  The  Online  EDS  system  will  walk  you  through  the  EDS   questions. Please see the User Manual for details.   Q:  How do I fill out a Disclosure of Retained Parties?   A:  There is no longer a separate Disclosure of Retained Parties filing. After logging in, click on “Create   6 | P a g e                                                            Addendum No. 1  Specification No. 704315   New”.  Answer (click) “Contract” to “Is this EDS for a contract or an EDS information update?”  Click  “Fill out EDS”, and click on the “Retained Parties” tab.  When finished, click on “Ready to Submit.”   Q:  How do I attach documents?   A:  Attachments are  discouraged. If at all  possible, please provide  a concise explanation in the space  provided  in  the  online  form.  Attachments  with  pages  of  officers  are  not  acceptable.  Names  of  officers  must  be  typed  into  the  system.  If  you  must  provide  an  attachment  for  another  reason,  please  send  it  to  your  City  of  Chicago  contact  (contract  administrator  or  negotiator  for  procurements) and they will attach it for you. Documents can be sent in PDF (preferred), Word, or  paper format.   Q:   Who can complete an Economic Disclosure Statement online?   A:   Any  authorized  representative  of  your  business  with  a  user  ID  and  password  can  complete  your  EDS  online.  One  person,  such as  an  assistant,  can  fill  in the information  and save it,  and another  person can review and electronically sign the Online EDS.   Q:  What are the benefits of filing my Economic Disclosure statement electronically?   A:   Filing electronically reduces the chance of filing an incomplete EDS and speeds up the processing  of contract awards. A certificate of filing can be printed at the completion of the process and inserted  into your bid package. The biggest benefit for those who frequently do business with the City is that  after the first EDS, each EDS is much easier to fill out because non-contract specific information is  pre-filled from the last submitted EDS.   Q:   Will my information be secure?   A:   Yes. When making your internet connection to our Web Server, you will connect through a Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL  for  short)  to  the  “Online  EDS”  login  page.  All  information  you  type  will  be  protected  using  strong  encryption.  Within  the  login  page,  you  will  provide  us  with  a  user  ID,  password, and secret question for user authentication, Only you will have knowledge of this unique  identification information.   Q:   I am filing electronically. How do I sign my EDS?   A:   Once  you  have  completed  the  EDS,  you  will  be  prompted  to  enter  your  password  and  answer  to  your secret question. Together, these will serve as your electronic signature. Although you will also  print and physically sign an EDS certification of filing as a notice that your EDS was filed, your EDS  is complete as a legal document with only the electronic filing.   Q:   My address has changed. How can I update my information?   A:   You  must  be  an  EDS  Captain  for  your  organization  to  update  this.  Log-in  and  click  on  “Vendor   Admin, Site Administration.” Select the appropriate site and click edit.   Q:   I have more questions. How can I contact the Department of Procurement Services?   A:   Please contact the contract administrator or negotiator assigned to your solicitation or contract. You   may call DPS at 312-744-4900 between 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM Central Time.   Q:   Can I save a partially complete EDS?   A:   Yes. Click “Save”. To avoid data loss,  we recommend you save  your  work periodically  while filling   out your EDS.   7 | P a g e                                                            Addendum No. 1  Specification No. 704315   Q:   Do I have to re-type my information each time I submit an EDS?   A:   No.  The  system  will  remember  non-contract  specific  information  from  your  last  submitted  EDS  for  one year. This information will be filled-in for you in your new EDS. You will have an opportunity to  correct it if it has changed since your last filing. When you submit your new EDS, the information is  saved and the one-year clock begins running anew.   Q:   What are the system requirements to use the Online EDS?   A:   The following are minimum requirements to use the Online EDS:   •  A PDF viewer such as Adobe Reader is installed and your web browser is configured to display   PDFs automatically.
